## Pid Example

This is code from a class I took a couple years ago where all code was developed on Linux servers.

This program was created to fulfill homework/classroom requirements, not professional development.

Recorded Values:
A = 0
B = 15675
C = 15675
D = 15674

The getpid() function is used to get the process ID of the calling process
that is currently in effect. When this is used and outputted as the example
shows, the two different pids will be very close to one another because they
do not do many other processes before they are initialized. The fprintf()
function works similarly to printf(). It is used to output information to
the screen for the user to view. This function is important when user
interaction is involved. The main difference between fprintf and printf is the
fact that fprintf is formatted to print out to make it easier to read.
